/**
 * Hello I am Ezekiel Ramirez
 *
 * I am a computer science major at California Baptist University. I have some friends who
 * are changing majors to comp sci and I am creating these repos to help them learn basic
 * syntax in the java language. Most program languages behave the same, the major
 * difference being that the syntax changes.
 *
 * In this first lesson we will cover
 * - variable types
 * - outputting information to the screen
 * - using variables to create functions
 *
 * For more examples of what I cover in these programs you can head to w3schools java lessons
 * If you find yourself on a computer that doesn't have a programing environment set up
 * you can look up any online IDE, preferably one that has java.
 *
 * GIT commands
 * git add --all
 * git commit -m "Comment here"
 * git push
